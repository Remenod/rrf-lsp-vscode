# RRF G-code Language Server for vscode

A lightweight Language Server Protocol (LSP) extension for VS Code that provides rich language support for RepRapFirmware (RRF) G-code files.

## Features

Currently, in version 0.2.0, this extension provides intelligent **Hover Documentation**:
* Hover over any valid G/M/T-code, literal, function, meta command, operator, etc. to see its full title and description.
* Includes direct links to the official Duet3D documentation for deep dives.
* Smart validation: ignores invalid tool numbers (e.g., `T50` or `T-2`).

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `rrfgcode.activateOnGenericGcode`: Enable or disable LSP features for generic non RRF gcode files (enabled by default).

## Known Issues

* Autocompletion is not yet implemented (planned for future releases).
* Strict syntax validation and error highlighting are currently limited.
