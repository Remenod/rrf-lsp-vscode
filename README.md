# RRF G-code Language Server for VS Code

A lightweight Language Server Protocol (LSP) extension for VS Code that provides rich language support for RepRapFirmware (RRF) G-code files.

## Features

Currently, this extension significantly expands its capabilities, offering a comprehensive suite of tools for RRF developers:

* **Intelligent Hover Documentation**: Hover over any valid G/M/T-code, literal, function, meta command, or operator to see its full title and description, including direct links to the official Duet3D documentation.
* **Autocompletion**: Smart suggestions for commands, parameters, object model, and syntax as you type.
* **Syntax Highlighting & Validation**: Real-time syntax checking to help catch errors early, alongside improved highlighting for better readability.
* **Go to Definition**: Quickly navigate to where variables, macros, or specific references are defined.
* **Variable Renaming**: Safely rename variables across your G-code files.
* **Duet3D Object Model Support**: Deep integration with the RRF object model, allowing for accurate references and autocompletion of object model properties.
* **Operators Syntax Check**: LSP is able to correctly recognize incorrect operator usage patterns.
* **Scope check** Show diagnostics based on valid variable definitoion scope

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `rrfgcode.activateOnGenericGcode`: Enable or disable LSP features for generic non-RRF gcode files (enabled by default).

## Known Issues

* **Stability**: Version 0.3.0 introduces a massive increase in functionality. While tested, some of the newer features (like complex syntax validation and deep object model autocompletion) are still stabilizing and might behave unexpectedly in edge cases.
* Performance optimizations for very large G-code files are ongoing.
* No type checking
